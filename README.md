# Machine_Learning-Zomato_India_dataset
Zomato India data-set is challenging in every aspect.  
The final goal is to predict delivery time considering all  factors present in the dataset


For simplification purpose the model is build in three stages. 
1)Zomato_train_set
2)Zomato_test_set_clean
3)zomato_delivery_time_prediction

the notebook presents a complete analaysis and prediction of time along with the explanotary data analysis for better understanding.

The data cleaning can be achieved in a simple way using excel or any other tools.
In this case we have cleaned the data using algorithm in python.
